    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that I have made multiple times and enjoy every time. It's simple and takes
        a couple of hours in the crockpot.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>Chicken Breasts</ul>
    <ul>Spaghetti Sauce of choice</ul>
    <ul>Shredded Cheese</ul>
    <ul>Pasta of choice</ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>Step 1: Place your raw chicken breasts in the crockpot. If you would like to add some seasoning to it, go ahead.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Cover the season with the full container of spaghetti sauce. It should be enough to cover the chicken.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Cook the chicken and sauce for 3-4 hours on high, 4-5 hours on low.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Once it gets close to the final hour mark for the chicken (I usually do 30 minutes before), shred the chicken.</li>
    <li>Step 5: Once shredded and mixed in the sauce, add a half cup of shredded cheese. If you want to add some extra protein, add some cottage cheese as well and stir well.</li>
    <li>Step 6: Boil some water to cook the pasta.</li>
    <li>Step 7: Strain the water from the pasta and add the pasta into the crockpot. Mix it all together</li>
    <li>Step 8: Add some more shredded cheese to the top of the mix and cover for another 10-15 minutes for the cheese to melt and the pasta to abosorb some of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Step 9: Add some garnish if you want it to look pretty. Plate and serve your meal.</li>
