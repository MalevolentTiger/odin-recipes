    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that I have made multiple times and enjoy every time. It's simple and takes
        a couple of hours in the crockpot.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>Breakfast Bowl</ul>
    <ul>Tortilla</ul>
    <ul>Shredded Cheese</ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>Step 1: Make the breakfast bowl in the microwave.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Split the breakfast bowl evenly into two tortillas and add some extra shredded cheese.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Heat a pan up and lay the burritos in it for a minute or two of both sides to slightly brown them and help them not open back up.</li>
    <li>Step 4: You're done! Repeat for as many as you want to make. Can easily wrap in aluminium foil and freeze for later.</li>
